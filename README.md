# Fetch-Data-Analysis

This is a python script that creates dataframes from three json files and performs some rudimentary analysis on the data.

Run the script in the commandline as follows:
python3 table_builder.py receipts.json users.json brands.json

For a few questions and concerns about data quality, see the data_quality_issues.txt file.

And for a message with questions for the stakeholders, please see the stakeholder_comminque.tx file.

Thanks and enjoy!
